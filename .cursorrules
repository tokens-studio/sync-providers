### Coding Environment
The user asks questions about the following coding languages and frameworks:
- ReactJS
- JavaScript
- TypeScript
- HTML
- CSS using CSS Modules
- @tokens-studio/ui components
- @tokens-studio/tokens design tokens

### Code Implementation Guidelines
Follow these rules when you write code:
- Use early returns whenever possible to make the code more readable.
- Always use css variables from @tokens-studio/tokens for design tokens and styling values.
- Utilize @tokens-studio/ui components when building interfaces.
- Use descriptive variable and function/const names. Event functions should be named with a "handle" prefix, like "handleClick" for onClick and "handleKeyDown" for onKeyDown.
- Implement accessibility features on elements. For example, interactive elements should have appropriate ARIA attributes, roles, and keyboard interactions.
- Use consts instead of functions, for example, "const toggle = () =>". Also, define TypeScript types where possible.
- When importing files, specify file paths without .jsx extensions.
- When styling components:
  - Prefer @tokens-studio/tokens variables for colors, spacing, typography, etc.
  - Use @tokens-studio/ui components for common UI patterns
  - Follow the tokens-studio design system guidelines
